                    <p>Dr. Michela Taufer, an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and Association 
                        for Computing Machinery Distinguished Scientist, holds the Jack Dongarra Professorship in High-Performance
                         Computing (HPC) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  She earned her B.S. in Computer Engineering 
                         (University of Padova, Italy) and Ph.D. in Computer Science (ETH Zurich, Switzerland).  A former postdoctora
                          fellow at the University of California, San Diego and The Scripps Research Institute, Dr. Taufer is dedicated
                           to multidisciplinary research, connecting computational and experimental sciences.  Her work focuses on 
                           designing HPC, cloud, and volunteer computing solutions, applying artificial intelligence/machine learning
                            to scientific applications, and advancing algorithms and workflows with a solid commitment to reproducibility
                             and transparency in research.
