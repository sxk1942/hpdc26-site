        title: ": Physics-Aware, Full-Stack Software to Accelerate Practical Quantum Computing"
        abstract: >-
          Quantum software can be a force multiplier that can significantly
          shorten the timeline for utility-scale results from quantum hardware.
          In particular, several key research directions will help realize
          practical quantum advantage. Physics-aware, cross-layer optimizations
          will continue to yield important efficiencies to allow
          applications to make the most of quantum resources. Software-directed
          noise-aware optimization and error correction, in particular, will be key to increasing
          gate depths and maintaining acceptable output fidelity.
          Pulse-level optimizations and specialized native gates will
          also be key enablers. Additionally, applications will be hybrid
          computations involving high-performance classical resources
          as well as quantum hardware serving as special-purpose accelerators.
          Effectively partitioning computations between these
          classical and quantum resources will be necessary to support
          realistic applications. Additionally, deep compiler optimization
          and classical simulation of Clifford and near-Clifford circuits
          can also be important classical investments towards more
          efficient quantum computations. Finally, defining abstractions
          that control compiler complexity yet selectively expose key
          physical machine properties will also be a key area of
          research.

            abstract: "High-Performance Computing (HPC) is not just a service we offer; it is part of Google's foundational DNA. This presentation explores the deep history of HPC within Google, from the early days of massive-scale indexing and distributed computing with technologies like MapReduce and Borg, to the sophisticated infrastructure that powers our global services today. We will trace this unique evolutionary path, demonstrating how decades of internal innovation in running planetary-scale workloads have directly informed the architecture and capabilities of Google Cloud's HPC offerings.

Attendees will learn how this heritage translates into a robust and flexible cloud ecosystem designed to support the most demanding research challenges. Furthermore, we will delve into how Generative AI is revolutionizing the very methods of HPC development and management. We will discuss how services like Gemini Code Assist are accelerating the creation of complex simulation code and simplifying workflow scripting, while platforms like Google Colab provide an accessible environment for prototyping and analysis.

Through real-world case studies in fields such as genomics and climate science, we will highlight how our infrastructure, now augmented by AI-powered tools, is empowering researchers to push the boundaries of discovery. Finally, we will look to the future, discussing how Google is continuing to democratize access to world-class HPC, fostering innovation, and helping the scientific community solve the grand challenges of tomorrow."

          In their 2017 Turing Lecture, Hennessy and Patterson declared that we were entering a “Golden Age” of computer architecture, and in fact it seems that high end computing using advanced architecture has become central to everything we now do daily. Multi-core chips and GPUs rule unchallenged but were virtually unheard of 20 years ago. New 100MW data centers appear daily. However, it is becoming clear that we may need to consider rebooting what we mean by “computation,” especially at the high end. It took 7 years longer to get from classical “petascale” computation to “exascale” than it did from “terascale” to “petascale.” Is another 1000X (“zettascale”) even possible?<br>At the same time radically new computational “lifeforms” are crawling onshore. To suggest a few, photonics already rules all but nearest neighbor networking, novel technologies are emerging that allow “memory” to do computation that breaks the von Neumann bottleneck, and quantum totally changes what it means to do computation. AI seems poised to invade every aspect, even classical “scientific” computation. The rise of social media means that we are dealing with graph-like structures with billions of vertices and trillions of edges. Networking everything means that computation now occurs “everywhere.”<br>This panel will discuss these phenomena and what that means we might see featured at HPDC five and ten years from now.

        abstract: >-
          Today, scientific computing workflows are increasingly operating at scales where nondeterminism, opaque AI decisions, and rising energy demands are no longer exceptions—they have become the norm. In this talk, I will present the concrete methods we are using to address these challenges within the scientific discovery process. Specifically, I will demonstrate how graph-based analysis can reveal sources of nondeterminism in large High-Performance Computing (HPC) simulations, how fine-grained provenance frameworks can enhance transparency in AI-driven workflows, and how predictive engines can eliminate redundant computations in neural architecture search, thereby significantly reducing energy costs.<br> Beyond individual solutions, I will outline a broader vision for computing that integrates data, experiments, and computation into comprehensive scientific ecosystems, exemplified by the National Science Data Fabric (NSDF). The talk will connect technical advancements to the larger goal of producing scientific results that are trustworthy, explainable, and efficiently generated at scale.
