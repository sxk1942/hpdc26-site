description: >
  The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for
  presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high-end
  computing. The 35th HPDC will take place in Cleveland, OH, USA, July 13-16, 2026.

scope: >
  Submissions are welcomed on high-performance parallel and distributed computing (HPDC) topics including but not limited to: clouds,
  clusters, grids, big data, massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Experience reports of operational deployments
  that provide significantly novel insights for future research on HPDC applications and systems are also welcome.

topics:
  - Datacenter, HPC, cloud, serverless, and edge/IoT computing platforms
  - Heterogeneous computing accelerators and non-volatile memory systems
  - File and storage systems, I/O, and data management
  - Operating systems and networks
  - System software and middleware for parallel and distributed systems
  - Programming languages and runtime systems
  - Big data stacks and big data ecosystems
  - Scientific applications, algorithms, and workflows
  - Resource management and scheduling
  - Performance modeling, benchmarking, and engineering
  - Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability
  - Operational guarantees, risk assessment, and management
  - Energy efficiency and sustainability
  - AI topics, which must relate to parallel and distributed computing systems
  - Novel post-Moore computing technologies including neuromorphic, brain-inspired computing, and quantum computing

scope_continued: >
    HPDC welcomes submissions that utilize AI to enhance the above topics of interest or that utilize distributed systems to enhance AI frameworks, but we highlight that an HPDC submission must address and articulate its connection with parallel and distributed computing research.
