description: >
  The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for presenting 
  the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high-end computing. The 35th HPDC 
  will take place in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, from July 13 to 16, 2026.

scope: >
  We welcome submissions on high-performance parallel and distributed computing (HPDC) topics, including but not limited to: clouds, clusters, grids, 
  big data, massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Experience reports of operational deployments that provide significantly novel 
  insights for future research on HPDC applications and systems are also welcome.


topics:
  - Infrastructure, including datacenter, HPC, cloud, serverless, and edge/IoT computing platforms
  - Accelerators and heterogeneous computing
  - Memory systems
  - File and storage systems, I/O, and data management
  - Operating systems and networks
  - System software and middleware for parallel and distributed systems
  - Programming languages and runtime systems
  - Big data stacks and significant data ecosystems
  - Parallel and distributed computing systems and software for AI
  - Scientific applications, algorithms, and workflows
  - Resource management and scheduling
  - Performance modeling and benchmarking
  - Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability
  - Deployment topics, including operational guarantees, risk assessment, and management
  - Energy efficiency and sustainability
  - Software engineering for parallel and distributed systems
  - Novel post-Moore computing technologies, including but not limited to neuromorphic, brain-inspired computing, and quantum computing


scope_continued: >
    HPDC welcomes submissions that utilize Artificial Intelligence to enhance the topics of interest mentioned above or that employ parallel and distributed 
    systems to improve AI workloads. However, we emphasize that an HPDC submission must clearly address and explain its connection to research in parallel and distributed computing.
