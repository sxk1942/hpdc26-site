            <h4>Speaker Instructions</h4>
            <p>We are looking forward to your talk at the conference!  The main conference will provide projection equipment and a laptop.  You may either connect your own laptop via HDMI or present PDF, PPT, or Google Slides via the conference laptop. Please see the session chair in the break prior to your session to ensure that your slides are loaded correctly.</p>
            <p>Please note that all talks must adhere to time limits to keep the conference on schedule:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Keynote Speakers</b> - Plan 50 minutes presentation followed by 10 minutes of discussion.</li>
                <li><b>Industry Speakers</b> - Plan 25 minutes presentation followed by 5 minutes of discussion.</li>
                <li><b>Technical Papers</b> - Plan 20 minutes presentation followed by 5 minutes of discussion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The session chair will hold up a sign to indicate when there are 5 minutes left and one minute left. If time is up, then wrap it up so the next speaker can start on time.</p>

            <h4>Poster Presentations</h4>
            <p>Please prepare a poster of maximum size 48x36 inches, and arrange to print it prior to the conference.  There is a <a href="https://local.fedex.com/en-us/in/notre-dame/office-5037">FedEx Office location on the Notre Dame campus</a> where you can arrange to print and pick up onsite, but please send your print at least one week in advance, since there will be many posters queued up.</p>
            <p>Posters will be presented at the Monday night reception on the 7th floor of the Duncan Student Center.  The conference will provide easels, poster boards, and tacks to secure your posters to the boards.  Please set up your poster by 6:00PM, enjoy some dinner, and then be ready to present your poster from 6:30PM to 7:30PM.</p>
            <p>Poster presentations will include a mix of refereed posters from the main conference, along with posters representing workshop papers, and posters from summer research students at Notre Dame.</p>
