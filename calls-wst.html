            HPDC warmly invites proposals for workshops and tutorials to take place on July 20, 2025.  <br><br>
            Workshops offer a platform for valuable discussions among researchers and practitioners, focusing on key
            topics and emerging research areas in the field of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and distributed
            computing.

            <br><br>

            Workshops typically feature a blend of invited talks, peer-reviewed papers, panel discussions,
            and work-in-progress presentations. Workshop organizers are encouraged to structure their sessions for an
            audience of approximately <strong>20-40 participants,</strong> with flexibility for <strong>either a full
            day or half day</strong> format depending on interest and space availability.

            <br><br>

            We welcome proposals for workshops on new, innovative topics as well as submissions to continue successful
            workshops from previous years. Note that proceedings of HPDC workshops will be published by the ACM in
            dedicated proceedings.

            <br><br>
            
            The selected workshops and tutorials will be held on the first day of the conference (July 20th).
